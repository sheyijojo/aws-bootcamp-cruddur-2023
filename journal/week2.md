# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Homework Challenges

- [ ] Instrument Honeycomb for the frontend-application to observe network latency between frontend and backend

- [ ] Add custom instrumentation to Honeycomb to add more attributes eg. UserId, Add a custom span

- [ ] Run custom queries in Honeycomb and save them later eg. Latency by UserID, Recent Traces

#### What the heck is distributed tracing?

- Distributed tracing is a method of tracking application requests as they flow from frontend devices to backend services and databases. Developers can use distributed tracing to troubleshoot requests that exhibit high latency or errors.

- Traces is what is needed for development! 

#### What the heck is Instrumentation?
Instrumentation is the data that sends the code that makes these trace. e.g Amazon x-ray, Honeycomb

#### create environment on Honeycomb - bootcamp
- protect your api keys
- data can be added to


## Honeycomb Setup 
#### Overview:
```sh
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
export HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
gp env HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
```
- #### API key set up, standardized for honeycomb
- Get API key from honeycomb website:
 - ``export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""``
 - Put in your api key in here:
 - ``gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""``
 - gp env is persistent for gitpod wheneve it restarts the env


 #### why export env is important
 Subshell annd shell reason when running commands.

#### set up service name
- `export HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur`
- `gp env HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"`
- otel service name is the standard
 - `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "${HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME}"`
- Otel service name determines the service name in the spans that gets sent from my application. 
- We want different service name for multiple back end services sending traces to honeycomb in a docker compose file, don't want the name consistenet accross. 

#### Backend Solution to setting up service from above

- Hard code it into docker compose file 
- We dont to set ```export HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur``` directly, it is specific to a service.
- set `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "${HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME}"` in the docker-compose file in the service env with a service name `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "${backend-flask}"backend-flask`

[otel](/_docs/assets/otelservice.jpg)

- Entire project should have honeycombAPI key
- Not as easy for the frontend, especially automatic instrumentations


##### OTEL - OPEN TELEMETRY
Configuring OTEL to send to Honeycomb. The libs installing our app is opensource.They are from the OTEL project(part of CNCF- Cloud Native Foundations), which runs kubernetes

#### Add to the backend environment on docker-compose file
`cd backend-flask`
```sh
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "${HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME}"
```

#### What is happening above ? Honeycomb not in cloud environment
Honey comb is not in my cloud environment. Cloud env is sending standardized messages out to oneycomb, honeycomb stores in our database and gives a ui to look at them.
we could can change this configs and send to other OTEL backend. Not tied to honeycomb alone.

#### Add to instrumentation requirements - code from honeycomb python

```sh
opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```

#### install instrumentation packages in requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### intialize instrumentations inside app.py
```sh
# app.py updates
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

```
