#### What the heck is distributed tracing?

Distributed tracing is a method of tracking application requests as they flow from frontend devices to backend services and databases. Developers can use distributed tracing to troubleshoot requests that exhibit high latency or errors

## Homework Challenges

- [ ] Instrument Honeycomb for the frontend-application to observe network latency between frontend and backend

- [ ] Add custom instrumentation to Honeycomb to add more attributes eg. UserId, Add a custom span

- [ ] Run custom queries in Honeycomb and save them later eg. Latency by UserID, Recent Traces
